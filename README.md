# MultiStream

#### Version 0.1a

Flask app for fetching if Twitch streams are live, and if so redirecting to multistre.am for the live users.

## Usage

To run this app locally for testing purposes run the `run.py` file which enables debug. For server deployment I suggest
using [uwsgi](http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and using it to run `app.py` directly.
